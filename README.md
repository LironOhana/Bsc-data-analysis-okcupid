# OKCupid Profiles — Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on OKCupid user profiles.  
The goal is to explore patterns in demographics, lifestyle choices, and written profile sections, and to communicate insights using clear visualizations.

## Project goals
- Clean and prepare a real-world dataset (missing values, mixed types, categorical features)
- Explore distributions and relationships between variables
- Generate clear, reproducible plots and summary insights

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized OKCupid profile attributes (e.g., age, location, orientation, lifestyle, and optional free-text sections).

**File used in this repo:**
- `data/okcupid_profiles.csv`

> If you prefer not to include raw data in GitHub, you can remove the CSV and keep only a small sample, and add a download/source link here instead.

## What’s inside
- Data loading & basic cleaning
- Missing value analysis
- Feature engineering (as needed)
- Visualizations (distributions, correlations/relationships)
- Summary insights and conclusions

## Notebook
